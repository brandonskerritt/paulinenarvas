When I was younger, I wanted to have my own website domain after my name.

I finally bought the domain and set-up it up (#grown ðŸ˜‰). Today it is now live and ready! I always find it hard to explain who I am, what I do and what I want to do but displaying it like this helps A LOT: I create, build, capture and share. ðŸŒŸ

Designed and developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap, presenting my online CV/portfolio/website!
